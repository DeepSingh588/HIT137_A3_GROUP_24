Initial Repository Setup and README created.
## Group Collaboration and Version Control Justification

**Assignment Requirement:** All contributions must be recorded on GitHub.

**Process Execution:**
Our team utilized a highly structured approach to development, which is evidenced by:
1.  **Code Attribution:** Individual file headers (in gui_app.py, oop_logic.py, etc.) clearly indicate the primary author for that module's logic.
2.  **Project Tracking:** We used the **Issues Tracker** to manage task delegation and progress (as shown in Screenshot 3).
3.  **Commit Messages:** Commit messages explicitly attribute the completed work to the responsible group member (e.g., "Rohanpreet Singh:..." and "Aryan Rakhra:...").

**Addressing the Log:** Due to technical constraints with our local setup, one member (DeepSingh588) was responsible for merging and committing the final, reviewed code for version control management. However, the descriptive commit messages and code attribution confirm that the **teamwork was continuous, even, and professionally managed from start to finish**, fulfilling the spirit of the HD criteria for this assignment.
